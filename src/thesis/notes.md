# Literature Researchi

## @perry2009torflow

- Torflow is a Library to analyse / measure Tor Nodes network activity

## @mccoy2008shining

- Analysing how the Tor Network is being used, did a survey also
- Developped a Method for exit router logging

## @jansen2012methodically

- How to model / simulate a tor network
  - highly relevant!
- Simulate using shadow

## @jansen2011shadow

- Present the shadow tool
- possibility to model tor network on a single machine

## @tippe2024onion

- Deanonymization of onion services
- More often its not a breach in the protocol but user errors such as misconfigurations

## @saputra2016detecting

- deep package inspection is also used by the gfw. therefore might be interesting

## dash2025categorically

- wireshark tor bridge snowflake traffic analysis
- how is the traffci changed
- webrtc protocol
- zoom calls are getting analyzed
- Not very relevant since i am not focusing on Snowflake and webrtc

## neverenough-sec2021

- has to be cited if the tornettool is used

## cherubin2022online

- WF Website Fingerprinting Attacks
- Uses actual Tor Traffic

## wang2013improved

- Introduced new fingerprinting techniques for the tor network

## wang2016realistically

- critically talks about the fingerprinting tests under labaratory conditions
- Good explanation of fingerprinting
- Found that fingerprinting wf can be very succesfull
- used actual datasets of banned websites from china / us / etc

## juarez2014critical

- Introduction to general WF attacks
- good explanations and graphics

## sirinam2018deep

- Introduce Deep WF Fingerprinting
- Using Deep Learning for Fingerprinting Attacks
- Probably a very important paper

## bhat2018var

- Improved Deep WF Fingerprinting

## jansen2023data

- WF Simulation in shadow. sehr relevant. mit sourcecode und tools
